Mint is being shut down so I'm making my own browser alternative... No connectivity with the banking APIs, though.

## Overview
This is a simple expense tracker app built with React. It allows users to upload expense data and view a breakdown of their expenses.

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies using ```npm install```
2. Start the development server using ```npx react-scripts start```
3. Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app in your browser.
